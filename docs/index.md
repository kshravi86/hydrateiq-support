## FAQ
**How do I log water quickly?**  
Use the quick-add cup buttons on the Today screen. You can customize cup sizes in Settings.

**How are daily goals calculated?**  
Goals are based on weight and activity level. You can override the suggested goal in Settings.

**What are smart reminders?**  
If enabled, you’ll get gentle reminders after inactivity and after logging a workout.

**Does HydrateIQ track caffeine?**  
Yes—when you log coffee, tea, or soda, caffeine is recorded so you can monitor intake.

**Where is my data stored?**  
All data is stored on-device. No account, no tracking, no cloud sync.

**How do I reset data?**  
Use Settings → Reset (if available) or delete and reinstall the app.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure notifications are enabled in iOS Settings if you’re not seeing reminders.
- Update to the latest iOS version for best compatibility.
